                <p class="card-text">
                  MANILA, Philippines– The Philippines’ warm and dry season for 2024 is underway, with hotter days ahead alongside the continued effects of the El Niño phenomenon.
                  <br><br>
                  The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) announced in a briefing on Friday, March 22, that the warm and dry season has begun.
                  <br><br>
                  Filipinos often call this season “summer,” but the country only has two major seasons: rainy and dry. The dry season is further divided into two: cool and warm.
                  <br><br>
                  The start of the warm and dry season means the cool and dry season, which is characterized by the northeast monsoon or amihan, has ended. The northeast monsoon affected parts of the country from October 2023 to March 2024.
                  <br><br>
                  “The retreat of the high pressure area over Siberia indicates an apparent weakening of amihan. Furthermore, the strengthening of the North Pacific High has led to a gradual shift in the wind pattern from northeasterly to easterly and an increase in the air temperature over most parts of the country. These signify the end of the northeast monsoon…and the beginning of the warm and dry season,” PAGASA explained in a statement on Friday.
                  <br><br>
                  The warm and dry season usually lasts until May. Temperatures are expected to rise during this period, with PAGASA issuing daily heat index figures.
                  <br><br>
                  “In the coming months, the number of dry and warm days across the country will continue to increase, although isolated thunderstorms are also likely to occur, usually in the afternoon or evening,” the weather bureau said.
                  <br><br>
                  PAGASA Administrator Nathaniel Servando advised people to take extra precautions to prevent illnesses such as heat stress and heat stroke.
                  <br><br>
                  “Sa mga susunod na mga araw ay tataas ang temperatura. Kung kasabay ang mataas na alinsangan o relative humidity, mataas ang heat index, at may kaakibat ito na hazard o panganib sa ating health. Maiiwasan lamang ito kung sundin natin ‘yung mga suggested interventions. Palaging mag-inom ng tubig, magdala ng payong, magsuot ng manipis na damit,” he said.
                  <br><br>
                  (In the coming days, temperatures will rise. Combined with high relative humidity, that will result in a high heat index, which comes with hazards to our health. We can avoid these hazards by practicing suggested interventions. Always drink water, bring an umbrella, wear thin clothing.)
