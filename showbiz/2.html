                Paolo Contis ‘no comment’ on relationship status with Yen Santos
              </h1>

              <p class="card-text">
                Paolo Contis remained tight-lipped about his relationship with
                actress Yen Santos, saying he wants to keep some parts of his
                personal life to himself as the public already knows a lot about
                it.
                <br /><br />
                “No comment!” the actor immediately responded after some members
                of the press shifted their tone from asking about his new film
                “Fuchsia Libre” to personal questions at the movie’s premiere
                night on Monday, May 13.
                <br /><br />
                Contis was then asked about Santos’ earlier social media
                activity of unfollowing the actor and removing their photos
                together on her Instagram page. Contis, in response, stressed
                that he also unfollowed certain individuals on Instagram but
                that it doesn’t mean he parted ways with them.
                <br /><br />
                The actor also dodged the question whether he and Santos are
                still friends. “No comment,” he reiterated with a teasing smile.
                <br /><br />
                “As I always say, masyado na kayong may alam sa buhay ko so I’d
                like to keep my personal life personal,” Contis underscored.
                <br /><br />
                Contis confirmed his relationship with Santos in January 2023,
                after over a year of speculations from the public. Months after
                the confirmation, he declared that he had plans of marrying
                Santos sometime in the future.
                <br /><br />
                The pair was rumored to have broken up as well last November
                after Contis was linked to his former fellow noontime show host
                Arra San Agustin.
                <br /><br />
                The actor dismissed the split speculations at the time, and
                clarified that the videos of him and San Agustin circulating on
                social media were “maliciously edited.”
