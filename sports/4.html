                <br />

                SPORTS: Gymnastics
                <br /><br />
                MANILA-- Filipino gymnast Carlos Yulo continues his build-up for
                the 2024 Paris Olympics in the Baku Leg of the 2024 FIG Artistic
                Gymnastics World Cup Series.
                <br /><br />
                Yulo secured a bronze medal in the men's floor exercise on
                Saturday, finishing with a score of 14.366. He placed behind
                gold medalist Yahor Sharamkou (14.933) and silver medalist
                Kazuki Minami (14.666).
                <br /><br />
                But Yulo missed out on the finals of the vault, where he placed
                just 21st in the elimination round.
                <br /><br />
                Gymnastics Association of the Philippines President Cynthia
                Carrion insists that Yulo remains on track in his build-up for
                the Paris Games, even as the gymnast is currently without a
                coach since his split from Munehiro Kugimiya in October 2023.
                <br /><br />
                "He is good and practicing his new skills for the Olympics and
                not competing to qualify since he is already qualified," said
                Carrion.
                <br /><br />
                Before the competition in Baku, Yulo had a training camp in
                England.
                <br /><br />
                He will travel to Manila in a few days to continue training, and
                fly to Australia at the end of March for another camp. Yulo is
                also set to compete in the Doha leg of the World Cup series in
                April, as well as the Asian Championships in Uzbekistan in May.
                <br /><br />
                Before the Paris Olympics in July, Yulo will also train in
                Europe. Yulo is one of four Filipino athletes already qualified
                to Paris, along with fellow gymnast Aleah Finnegan, boxer Eumir
                Marcial, and pole vaulter EJ Obiena.
                <br /><br />
                Yulo, who missed out on the podium in the Tokyo Olympics in
                2021, is aiming for more than one gold medal in Paris.
