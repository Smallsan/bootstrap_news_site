                Ginebra offers quarterfinals win over Magnolia to injured
                Malonzo
              </h1>

              <p class="card-text">
                EVEN if grounded following a calf surgery, Barangay Ginebra
                didn't overlook the absence of injured teammate Jamie Malonzo.
                <br /><br />
                The Kings were quick to dedicate their formal entry to the PBA
                Philippine Cup semifinals to the 6-foot-7 Malonzo following
                their 99-77 victory over rival Magnolia Hotshots in the opening
                round of the playoffs on Saturday at the Rizal Memorial
                Coliseum.
                <br /><br />
                Coach Tim Cone said the team offered the rousing win to the
                high-flying Fil-Am a day after undergoing surgery on his injured
                calf. "Basically, this game is for him. We did it for him," said
                Cone as the Kings quickly dispatched the Hotshots in their
                quarterfinals showdown.
                <br /><br />
                Malonzo suffered the injury in the final seconds of the Kings'
                95-88 win over Northport a month ago. The forward out of De La
                Salle initially wanted to have the injury heal on its own by
                resting, but doctors later advised him to undergo surgery
                instead. He went under the knife early Friday morning and is now
                resting at home.
                <br /><br />
                "I'm sure he watched us on TV. And I know he's chapping in a bit
                to get back in, but it's gonna take a while for him," said Cone.
                <br /><br />
                The Ginebra coach admitted it was a difficult adjustment for the
                Kings without having Malonzo around. "Don't underestimate how
                difficult it is for us to play without Jamie," said Cone of
                Malonzo, who averaged 14.1 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 3.2 assists
                prior to his injury.
                <br /><br />
                The surgery also meant the Ginebra forward will be out for the
                rest of the season and with Gilas Pilipinas in the coming
                Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Latvia.(RG)
