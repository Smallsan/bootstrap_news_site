                <p class="card-text">
                    MANILA, Philippines — It may sound stranger than fiction, but Sen. Risa Hontiveros on Wednesday raised the possibility that Mayor Alice Guo of Bamban town, Tarlac province, might be a Chinese “asset” trained to infiltrate and influence the Philippine government.
                    <br><br>
                    Hontiveros’ suspicion added yet another layer on the already intricate web of controversies surrounding the Philippine offshore gaming operator (Pogo) business, which flourished during the Duterte administration.
                    <br><br>
                    She said the investigation by the Senate, part of the continuing inquiry into Pogos that the committee on women and children opened last year, and other state agencies should focus on Guo’s ties with gaming operators and her personal background.
                    <br><br>
                    Pogos had been linked to human trafficking, kidnap-for-ransom, killings, illegal drugs, and internet fraud.
                    <br><br>
                    “During our hearing (on Tuesday), we nearly drowned in numerous revelations that led to more questions. First of all, is it true that Mayor Alice Guo is a Chinese national?” Hontiveros told a press briefing.
                    <br><br>
                    “This is an important question because [Guo] has no records in our country and she was instrumental in the entry of a very huge Pogo company in the Philippines,” she said.
                    <br><br>
                    “Did they plan this long ago to use [her] supposed Filipino identity to gain a foothold in our political (system) and even national security sector?” she asked.
                    <br><br>
                    She pointed out that Chinese nationals who had allegedly obtained legitimate Philippine passports and other government documents used late registered birth certificates.
                    <br><br>
                    “Is Guo, like all others who have a mysterious past, an asset that China sent to enter our government for them to have an influence in Philippine politics?” she said.
                    <br><br>
                    Guo, who was accompanied by a lawyer, said she was being subjected to trial by publicity.
                    <br><br>
                    “It is sad that I have been judged prematurely. I was tried publicly based on baseless allegations and made-up stories,” Guo said in a statement she read during Tuesday’s hearing.
                    <br><br>
                    Hontiveros earlier said that she received “persuasive information” from the intelligence agencies that the vast Pogo complex in Bamban, which the authorities had raided on March 13, was linked to surveillance operations and hacking of government websites.
